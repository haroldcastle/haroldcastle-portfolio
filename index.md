## Portfolio

Since August 2021, I have been preparing for and worked intensely on several projects that have opened the doors to a new career. Displayed below, I have selected and curated just a few of them, to showcase my skills. I hope you enjoy them!

### Initial Projects  

[Retail Business Analysis](/sample_page)

In this project we used the data from Adventure Works to simulate the typical day-to-day operations of a Data Analyst, using Power BI to satisfy the internal requirements. Different professionals inside a corporation are trying to get insights from the latest sales and financial statements.  In my personal opinion, the main takeaway is that regardless of how successful you were in the previous fiscal year, there are always opportunities for improvement and is the job of the DA to showcase them in the most efficient and attractive way.

On the business side, it was great to see the granularity of how the traffic of the page is recorded, so you can get every level of interaction and discern where you need to focus to grow the business. On the technical side I believe the genius way of using nested structures is simple and yet effective to achieve the objective of making easier the understanding of Google Analytics metrics. 

[Home Credit Default Risk](http://example.com/)

Home Credit strives to broaden financial inclusion for the unbanked population by providing a positive and safe borrowing experience. In order to make sure this underserved population has a positive loan experience, Home Credit makes use of a variety of alternative data--including telco and transactional information--to predict their clients' repayment abilities.

While Home Credit is currently using various statistical and machine learning methods to make these predictions, they're challenging Kagglers to help them unlock the full potential of their data. Doing so will ensure that clients capable of repayment are not rejected and that loans are given with a principal, maturity, and repayment calendar that will empower their clients to be successful.
